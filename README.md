Code to accompany and extend the exercises in Guide to Scientific Computing in C++ by Joe Pitt & Francis Jonathon Whiteley (2nd Ed.)

I skip all aspects of the exercises that require std::cin (reading from the user), e.g., 1.6.
Some chapters are integrated into other aspects of the code, e.g., chapter 3.

# Running

## WSL

cd path_to_folder/
cmake CMakeLists.txt
make
./ScientificComputing

## Visual Studio

1. Open folder

Visual Studio will try to run it and give some error about .exe or cache or something

2. Deleted the build folder in out/build.
3. Build again from the toolbar.
4. Select the ScientificComputing.exe from the toolbar, and press F5 to run.
